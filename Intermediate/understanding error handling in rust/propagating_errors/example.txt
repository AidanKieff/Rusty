Because Git uses a simple three-way merge, merging from one branch into another multiple times over a long period is generally easy to do. 
This means you can have several branches that are always open and that you use for different stages of your development cycle; 
you can merge regularly from some of them into others.

Many Git developers have a workflow that embraces this approach, 
such as having only code that is entirely stable in their master branch — possibly only code that has been or will be released. 
They have another parallel branch named develop or next that they work from or use to test stability — it isn’t necessarily always stable, 
but whenever it gets to a stable state, it can be merged into master. It’s used to pull in topic branches (short-lived branches, like your earlier iss53 branch) 
when they’re ready, to make sure they pass all the tests and don’t introduce bugs.
